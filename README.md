# AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System 
A Web Application for Automated Resume Evaluation

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is an AI-powered web application that automates the process of resume screening and ranking. It uses **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to evaluate resumes based on predefined criteria, providing a ranked list of candidates based on their suitability for a given job role.

## 🎯 Features  
- 📄 Resume Parsing – Extracts relevant information from resumes (e.g., skills, experience, education).  
- 🏆 AI-Based Ranking – Uses ML/NLP algorithms to rank resumes based on job requirements.  
- 🔍 Keyword Matching – Matches resumes with job descriptions using text analysis.  
- 📊 User-Friendly Dashboard – Web interface for HR professionals to upload and review ranked resumes.  
- 📁 Supports Multiple Formats – Accepts resumes in PDF and DOCX formats.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Frontend: Streamlit  
- Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django)  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if deep learning is used)  
- Data Processing: Pandas, NLTK/SpaCy  
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB (if applicable)  
- Deployment: AWS/GCP/Azure/Heroku
